        <p>Hey World! I'm Zunairah, a proactive highschool student who loves collaborating with driven individuals on various projects. I have always been fascinated with the capabilities of computer science and all it has to offer. Though I am not an expert in computer programming languages, I like problem solving and have coded on Replit to expand and enrich my skills and knowledge. I am passionate and determined about all computer science is capable of achieving and to allow myself to dive deeper, I took IS3UI, which has helped me enhance my skills in Python. In the portfolio section, you can view some of the codes I have made on Replit with description of each or directly view my Replit page (by clicking the link down below) and explore all the codes I have created. See my first ever, beginner level code, and view my progression through each assignment! </p>

        <p>Through my knowledge, I hope to translate my passion for computer science into new applications and endeavors that will one day help the world. I love to learn new things and challenge my limits to see what I can achieve so, through the vast knowledge on the internet, I have learned some concepts of HTML and my next goal is to familiarize myself with concepts of Java (codes of which I will upload soon on this website). Github was one way for me to learn how to code websites by learning through other people's websites by "forking". This allowed me to experiment, learn the basics and create this website that I can call my own. Because of my passion for learning and experimenting, I was able to go outside my comfort zone and learn new frameworks. In our technological age, I am not constrained by impossibilities, and with ever-changing technology, I am interested to see what the future holds. I am especially excited to collaborate with driven individuals to translate my passion for computer science into new applications to one day bring positive change for people around me, and possibly the world.
