description: Using conditional statements, nested loops, for loops, function definition and various in-built modules like tkinter, time, math and random, this animation project was created on Replit (Python). This animation is a short story showing the final moment of a sheep with its owner before its sad end .. or is it an end? I have added comments to show what each part of the code does, but here is a little run down. To create this project, firstly the various modules (tkinter, time, random, math) were imported and the background (grass, stars and fence) + sheep were created. I used for-loops and tkinter to form objects using different polygons and filled them with color. To show a moving spaceship, I again used for loops and tkinter but also time and coordinates. Following this pattern, I put together different polygons to form an image of a faceless person walking in and the sheep being elevated into the spaceship and it leaving. Lastly, using for-loops and time a falling tear was created. To end this short story all previous work was deleted and the words “Rest in Peace” were inputted.
