description: Using While Loops (Python) on Replit, this game was created for any youngster who is wanting to learn multiplication. The game displays a welcome message and asks user to enter their name. It then generates two numbers and prompts user to enter the product. According to the user's input, if the product number entered is true, a "correct" message is displayed, and the user receives one point for each correct response. If the user's input is wrong, the correct solution is shown. The game continues until the user enters “-1” and once entered, the game is over and the player's score is shown.
